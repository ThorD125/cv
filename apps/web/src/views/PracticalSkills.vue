    Some practical projects/experiences in IT

    Laptop: I've been running linux for quite some time, first started with ubuntu, swapped over to manjaro, for school swapped back to windows, then back to ubuntu
    PC: I've build my own pc, its running windows, with multiple wsl versions
    VM's: for school i used to run multiple vm's on my laptop and pc using vmware, now im using 1 kali vm in the hyper-v manager that windows uses to boot on my pc
    Mini server: On my internship i managed to buy a cheap intel nuc, on this is running debian with dockge (first just docker but some of the containers after a day or 2 became in accessible) as my docker stack manager, im running dmva, juice-shop, openspeedtest, pihole, a discord bot, minecraft server, some websites with caddy (a new nginx alternative) and a few other things
    Raspberry pi: I have a raspberry pi 4, and have played around with a lot of different things: turning a light on, home assistant, Raspberry Pi OS, pawnagotchi, and a few other things

    bachelor applied informatics - cyber security 
    - the projecte we did:
        in the first semister we made a disaster website to learn us to work with html, css and js
        in the second semister we did a monopoly project with the frontend in html, css and js, backend in java
        in the third semister we did:
            mars project this was a project where we developed a product for a civilazation on mars
            a honypot project each group got a little server and had to create a site with software they choose, our groupe used html, css, js, php this was, each group had to have 5 ctf kynd of challenges, and everyone had to try to hack the other students, the goal was to also create a dashboard with kibana elkstack and logstash to log hacking attempts, our teacher also did one attack and on the evalutation we had to show where/when he tried to attack our site on the dashboard and we could also report vulnerabilies to the teacher to get extra points
        in the fourth semister we did:
            a magic the gathering app using dotnet that showed the cards and their prices and people could trade cards with each other
            we had to create a mobile app using kotlin and showcase some small functionality and we had to use a database and also a fetch from a server, i used sqlite, we also had to create and exploit a vulnerability and use frida to exploit it
            an international project, everyone had a chance to go to an internatinol project of their choice, each spend a week in a different country, i went to spain on a mobile app development course
        in the fifth semister we had an hacking cities project, in groups of 2 we got 2 cities to go and pentest, we had to make a report and present it, we found some small vulnerebilities but our cities did upgrade everything the week before we came, so we couldnt find anything big, except for both cities we where able to just walk in.
