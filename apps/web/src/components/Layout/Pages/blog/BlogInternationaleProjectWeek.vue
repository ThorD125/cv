        <h3>Day 2: Training and Workshops</h3>

        <p>
            The second day was all about getting to grips with MIT App Inventor. A series of hands-on workshops and
            training sessions were conducted, led by experts in mobile app development. Even those with little to no
            prior experience in coding found themselves quickly understanding the basics and exploring the possibilities
            of the platform. By the end of the day, participants had their first taste of app development, creating
            simple apps and discovering the tool's user-friendly interface.
        </p>

        <h3>Day 3: Brainstorming and Ideation</h3>

        <p>
            With the fundamentals in place, day three was dedicated to ideation and brainstorming. Teams formed based on
            complementary skills and interests, and everyone came together to discuss potential app ideas. The goal was
            to identify real-world problems that could be solved through innovative mobile applications. By the end of
            the day, each team had a clear vision of their app concept and the problem they aimed to address.
        </p>

        <h3>Day 4: Prototype and Development</h3>

        <p>
            The excitement was palpable as participants dove headfirst into app development. Guided by seasoned mentors
            and instructors, teams started prototyping their apps. MIT App Inventor's drag-and-drop interface made the
            development process accessible to all, allowing for the rapid creation of functional prototypes. Teams began
            to see their ideas take shape, as their apps moved closer to reality.
        </p>

        <h3>Day 5: Testing and Refinement</h3>

        <p>
            With prototypes in hand, day five was dedicated to rigorous testing and refinement. Participants exchanged
            feedback and put their apps through their paces, identifying and ironing out bugs and improving user
            interfaces. The collaborative atmosphere was electric, as everyone helped each other refine their creations,
            ensuring that the apps would be both user-friendly and effective.
        </p>

        <h3>Day 6: Final Touches</h3>

        <p>
            As the week neared its end, teams polished their apps and added the final touches. Graphics, animations, and
            additional features were integrated to make the apps visually appealing and fully functional. The
            transformation from app concepts to real, working applications was nothing short of remarkable, showcasing
            the power of MIT App Inventor in enabling rapid app development.
        </p>

        <h3>Day 7: Presentation and Celebration</h3>

        <p>
            The grand finale of the project week arrived on day seven. Each team had the opportunity to present their
            app to the entire group. The diversity of ideas and solutions was astonishing, ranging from healthcare and
            education to entertainment and social impact. Celebrations followed as participants applauded each other's
            efforts, appreciating the immense progress made in just one short week.
