        In the ever-evolving landscape of cybersecurity, the need for young talent in this field has never been more
        critical. Belgium, like many other countries, recognizes this necessity and has been taking steps to promote and
        cultivate the next generation of cybersecurity experts. One such initiative is the
        <em>Cyber Security Challenge</em>, an annual event that provides students and industry professionals with a
        platform to test their skills and knowledge in the realm of cybersecurity. In March 2023, my friends and I
        eagerly participated in this exciting challenge, and although we didn't make it to the finals, the experience
        was nothing short of incredible.

    <h3>The Cyber Security Challenge: A Brief Overview</h3>

    <p>
        The Cyber Security Challenge in Belgium has been a resounding success since its inception in 2015. Its primary
        objective is to raise awareness and interest among students nearing the completion of their education in the
        field of information security. Over the years, the event has garnered increasing interest from both students and
        industry professionals, making it a highly anticipated event in the cybersecurity community.

    <h3>The Qualifiers: A Test of Skill and Strategy</h3>

    <p>
        In March 2023, the Cyber Security Challenge kicked off with the qualifiers, where registered teams were invited
        to participate in solving challenges on an online platform. This phase lasted for two intense days, starting at
        10:00 on a Friday morning and concluding at 18:00 on a Saturday evening. The challenges were designed to push
        the boundaries of our knowledge and skills in the cybersecurity domain. Registering our team on the Capture The
        Flag (CTF) platform was our first step into the world of competitive hacking.
