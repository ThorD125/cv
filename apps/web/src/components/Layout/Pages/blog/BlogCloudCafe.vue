            What an <span>incredible</span> experience it was at the Campus Cloud Café at Howest, Kortrijk! The
            event started at 5:00 PM and promised an engaging day full of <span>valuable</span> insights and
            opportunities to expand our professional network.
        </p>

        <h1>Session 1: "Real-life Use Cases with <span>Azure OpenAI</span>"</h1>
        <p>
            The first session, presented by Mathias Cheyns, was truly <span>inspiring</span>. He took us on a
            journey through the applications of Azure OpenAI in various industries and demonstrated how these advanced
            AI tools can solve <span>real-world</span> problems. As a developer or IT professional, I was certainly
            inspired by the <span>possibilities</span> of artificial intelligence.
        </p>

        <h1>Session 2: "Lessons Learned in Building an <span>Industrial IoT</span> Platform on Azure"</h1>
        <p>
            The second session by Toon Vanhoutte provided me with a deeper understanding of the challenges and
            opportunities of the <span>Internet of Things (IoT)</span>. His extensive experience undoubtedly offered
            <span>valuable</span> lessons for building industrial IoT platforms on Azure.
        </p>

        <h1>Intermission</h1>
        <p>
            After this session, it was time for a well-deserved break, and there was an abundance of
            <span>delicious</span> sandwiches available for everyone to enjoy. It was a great opportunity to
            <span>network</span> and converse with fellow participants while savoring some treats.
        </p>

        <h1>Session 3: "Azure Durable Functions 101"</h1>
        <p>
            Finally, the third session with Klaas Lauwers showed us how to build <span>scalable</span> and
            <span>reliable</span> serverless applications using Azure Durable Functions. This is
            <span>invaluable</span> for developers and architects seeking efficient solutions for their
            applications.
        </p>

        <p>
            All in all, the Campus Cloud Café at Howest in Kortrijk has been an <span>unforgettable</span> and
            <span>educational</span> experience.
